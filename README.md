## ChangeLog
- 18.02.2024 - restarted the repository. The existing repository with the same name got very messy. It had several abandoned branches containing some useful sources, but difficult to merge. So, I decided to delete the existing repository and start fresh.

## To Do

If you are new to the package and would like to contribute, please pick one of the items in the ToDo list below.

### Starter items
- `TimeIntervalUtilities` needs documentation.
